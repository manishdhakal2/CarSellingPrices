# Car Selling Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the selling prices of cars based on various features using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the selling price of cars based on attributes such as brand, model, year, mileage, and other relevant factors. The dataset used for this analysis contains information on used cars listed for sale.

## Project Structure

- `CarPrices.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `Final Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, findings, and conclusions of the project.
- `task_description.txt`: The original task description outlining the project requirements and objectives.

## AI Assistance

During the course of this project, AI tools were utilized to enhance the development process. These tools assisted in:

- Generating code snippets for data preprocessing and model building.
- Providing explanations for machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- Offering suggestions for data visualization and interpretation.

All AI-generated content was reviewed and integrated into the project manually, ensuring the final outputs align with the project's objectives and standards.

## Key Findings

- Feature engineering significantly improved model accuracy.
- Certain car attributes, such as brand and mileage, had a higher impact on price predictions.
- The final model achieved a satisfactory performance, with potential for further optimization.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- torch
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn torch
```
